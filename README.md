Based on Poseidon, but ready for multiple access and pluggable architecture. Also has commands baked into that can help with network debugging.

Needs bRO client bRO_2016-04-03a. You can workaround this by providing the newest connection info, but don't ask for my help.

Since this has been leaked to many times, I decided to make it OSS so that everyone can have it's benefits.

## Usage example

Had no time to write examples. Please, contribute :)
